# Server Bot

Runs two anchored VWAP paper bots from one repository and the exact `paper_bot_config.json` exported by the `anchored_vwam_backtest` calculator:

- `reference_bot` is sourced from `anchored_vwam_backtest/paper_trading_bot`.
- `live_paper_bot` is sourced from `anchored_vwam_paper_bot/live_paper_trading_bot`.

Both bots receive identical strategy and market settings. Their ledgers, cursors, candle caches, logs, PIDs, and instance locks are separate, so they can run concurrently.

## Install

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

Copy and edit the shared configuration if needed:

```bash
cp paper_bot_config.example.json paper_bot_config.json
nvim paper_bot_config.json
```

## Combined commands

```bash
uv run python -m server_bot.cli start
uv run python -m server_bot.cli status
uv run python -m server_bot.cli stats
uv run python -m server_bot.cli stop
uv run python -m server_bot.cli reset
```

Use `start --resume` to retain both launch anchors and processing cursors.

## Independent foreground processes

For systemd, supervise each process directly rather than using the background `start` command:

```bash
uv run python -m reference_bot.cli run --resume --config ./paper_bot_config.json
uv run python -m live_paper_bot.cli run --resume --config ./paper_bot_config.json
```

Create two systemd services with the same working directory and config path, one for each command above.

## Runtime isolation

The reference bot writes `reference_*` files. The live-paper bot writes `live_paper_*` files. `reset` deletes both bots' runtime data but retains the shared configuration and logs.

Neither bot submits real exchange orders. Bybit credentials are used only for the read-only fee-rate endpoint. MEXC uses public market and fee data.
